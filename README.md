# InfiniBand-Topology-Builder
A set of scripts to generate InfiniBand topology files

# FatTreeBuilder.py
FatTreeBuilder will build a k-ary-n-tree of a given k/n. The output is in the format used by ibnetdiscover utility,
meaning that you can use the topologies generated by this script directly in ibsim. The output is printed in STDOUT, so if you
want to save the generated topology in a file for further analysis or use with different tools, you need to redirect the output
of the script in a file.
